## What is this?
A really rudementary sand simulator in java, or particle simulator. Really basic stuff, did it for learning purposes.
**Currently not functional, as I'm in the process of doing some changes to the way I handle each particle.**

## Is this useful?
No, Its a project I make for learning purposes, so expect it to be really bad. Made it public for portafolio purposes only.
Feel free to take anything from my ~~really bad~~ code.
